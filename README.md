=================

You will need to load this into a CloudPebble.com application.  Create a "Pebble.js" project and paste the code here in src/app.js (of this Github project) into your new Pebble.js project (in CloudPebble.com). You can use Cloudpebble.com to deploy your code directly to the watch, as well as cloud storage for your code. A video demo and all project information for this code is available here:
http://contractorwolf.com/sparkcore-smart-garage/


To run this code you will need to replace the following lines with the DeviceID and Authentication Token using Spark.io Web IDE:
//*******************

var DEVICE_ID = "54xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//FROM SPARKCORE IDE

var ACCESS_TOKEN = "f75xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//FROM SPARKCORE IDE

//*******************
