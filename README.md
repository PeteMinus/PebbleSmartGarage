You will need to load this into a CloudPebble.com application.  Create a "Pebble.js" project and paste the code here in src/app.js (of this Github project) into your new Pebble.js project (in CloudPebble.com). You can use Cloudpebble.com to deploy your code directly to the watch, as well as cloud storage for your code. A video demo and all project information for this code is available here:
